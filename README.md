**Biomes O' Plenty** is a **Minecraft mod** that adds **over 50 new biomes** to the overworld and Nether. From coral reefs to bamboo forests, all of our biomes are decorated with a slew of **new plants, trees, flowers, and more!**

-----------------

Note: To use the mod on a **server**, you must set the **level-type** setting in your server's config file to **BIOMESOP**

-----------------

**Please note that the 1.8.9 version is still in development.  Whilst it may have many bugs fixed compared to 1.7, there will still be some missing features.**

**The configuration system for biomes is implemented, however it remains undocumented at this time.  Most world-breaking changes should be complete at this point, however do be aware that they are still possible.**
