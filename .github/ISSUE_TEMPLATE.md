You must ensure the following before reporting an issue with the mod.

----------------------------------------

- [ ] Biomes O' Plenty is updated to the latest available version.
- [ ] This issue occurs with Minecraft 1.12. 

**We *DO NOT* support Minecraft versions 1.7.10, 1.8.9, 1.9.4, 1.10.2, 1.11 or anything below that!**  

**YOUR ISSUE WILL AUTOMATICALLY BE CLOSED IF IT IS PERTAINING TO THOSE VERSIONS!**

- [ ] Forge is updated to the latest available version.

- [ ] This issue occurs *WITHOUT* Optifine, Sponge or similar mods installed.

**Mods such as Optifine and Sponge interfere with the normal functioning of the game by modifying its code.**
**We do not support these mods in any way as they can introduce bugs which would not normally be present with**
**only Forge installed.**

- [ ] This issue can be reproduced with ONLY Biomes O' Plenty and any other affected mods.

- [ ] All other mods which appear to be involved are updated to their latest versions.

- [ ] I have included any relevant logs and screenshots below.

**If this is a compatibility issue with another mod, you *MUST* test with *ONLY* Biomes O' Plenty and that specific mod.**
**Logs containing masses of mods are extremely unhelpful, and it is unlikely that your issue will be addressed.**

- [ ] This issue does not occur in a modpack. 

** Issues with modpacks should be reported to the modpack author(s). As noted above, mod compatibility issues must **
** occur with the latest versions of both Biomes O' Plenty and the affected mod. The issue *MUST* be tested with *ONLY* **
** Biomes O' Plenty and the affected mod. **
